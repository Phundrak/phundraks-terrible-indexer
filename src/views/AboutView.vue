    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      This website is a front-end for my custom document indexer. It runs with
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> with
      <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">Typescript</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the backend runs with
      <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>. Its web
      server is powered by
      <a href="https://rocket.rs/" target="_blank">Rocket</a> while its
      interactions with
      <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> is
      powered by <a href="https://diesel.rs/" target="_blank">Diesel</a>.

      The source code is unavailable for now, but it will be free to access
      hopefully somewhat soon.
